{
    _id: String,
    title: String,
    adminId: String,
    subjects: Array({
        name: String,
        count: Number,
    }),
    students: Array({
        name: String,
        prn: String,
        elective: String,
    }),
    count: Number,
    maxLimit: Number,
}

Listen I have to make three updates,
1. Increase the count by one of the subject object with a "subjectName" in the subjects array 
2. Set the elective to "subjectName" of the student object in with properties "studentName" and "prn" in students array
3. Increase the count by one in the root of elective object

It' the first day of 75 hard challenge;
